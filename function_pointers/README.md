function_pointers

In C, a function pointer is a type of pointer that stores the address of a function, allowing functions to be passed as arguments and invoked dynamically. It is useful in techniques such as callback functions, event-driven programs, and polymorphism (a concept where a function or operator behaves differently based on the context).
